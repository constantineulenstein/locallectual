Traditional organizations may also have limitations when identifying some specific needs, disabilities, or other barriers that cannot be addressed on a more micro level. Locallectual aims to bridge this gap by putting both sides directly in touch. Creating friendships and connections that are both authentic, lasting, and fruitful."
